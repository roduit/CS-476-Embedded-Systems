#### Structure:

The virtual prototype consists of three directories:

- modules: This directory contains the several modules that are contained in the SOC. Add your own modules in this directory. Most modules also contain a ```doc``` directory with documentation.
- programms: This directory contains the "hello world" template that can be used as basis for your own programms.
- systems: This directory contains all the required files for the "top level" of the SOC.

#### Hardware configuration files:

To be able to build the Virtual Prototype hardware, there are several files:

- systems/singleCore/scripts/gecko4_or1420.tcl: This file contains the pin-mapping of the top level to the FPGA-pins. For the add-on board they are already contained as remarks, for the one's of the GECKO4Education you can visit [the wiki page](https://gecko-wiki.ti.bfh.ch/gecko4education_epfl:start).
- systems/singleCore/config/project.device.intel: This file contains the definitions of the FPGA used on the GECKO4Education. Do not modify this file.
- systems/singleCore/config/project.files: This file contains a list with all Verilog files that are required to build the Virtual Prototype. If you add modules, you have also to modify this file such that the modules are found.
- systems/singleCore/config/project.intel: This file contains generic commands for the Intel Quartus Lite tool. Do not modify this file.
- systems/singleCore/config/project.qsf: This file is responsible to include the gecko4_or1420.tcl file. Do not modify this file.
- systems/singleCore/config/project.toplevel: This file contains the name of the top-level module. Normally you should not have to modify this file.

#### Building the hardware:

As the tools are quite "heavy" and to provide a automated flow, a makefile system is used. To build the system:

- Goto the directory systems/singleCore/ (e.g. ```cd systems/singleCore/```).
- Type: ```make intel_bit```
- If no errors occurred you'll find in the directory ```systems/singleCore/sandbox``` the files ```or1420SingleCore.cfg``` and ```or1420SingleCore.rbf```. These files can be used to program your FPGA with the open-source tool ```openocd``` of the oss-cad-suite by executing ```openocd -f or1420SingleCore.cfg``` on the machine to which the GECKO4Education board is connected. Alternatively you can use the intel quartus programmer, for this you require the file ```or1420SingleCore.sof```, which is also available in the directory ```systems/singleCore/sandbox```

#### Building the software:

Also the software is based on a makefile system. To build a program follow following steps (with as example the hello world program):

- Goto the directory ```programms/helloWorld```
- Execute ```make clean mem```
- If no error occurred, you will find in the directory ```programms/helloWorld/build-release/``` the files ```hello.elf```, ```hello.cmem```, and ```hello.mem```. The file that you need to upload to your board is the ```hello.cmem```-file.
- Upload the ```hello.cmem```-file with your favorite terminal program to your virtual prototype.

IMPORTANT: As the or1420 does not contain a hardware-divide unit you have to compile your programm with the compile option ```-msoft-div```!
