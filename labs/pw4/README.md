# CS-476: Embedded Systems Design
## PW4: Build-in peripheral DMA-controller

### Part 1
The purpose of the first task was to construct a first skeleton for the DMA attached memory. In order to test the functionalities of the module, a testbench is created. The code for this testbench can be found under `part1/virtual_prototype/verilog/ramDmaCi_tb.v`. A .gtkw file is also provided with all the interesting signals nicely ordered. This file can be found under: `part1/virtual_prototype/verilog/part1.gtkw`. \
This testbench performs write operations initiated by the CPU to a memory. After what, it reads the same memory locations.
