The or1400 has some important changes with respect to the OR1k architectural
document, namely:

 1) The special purpose registers are incompatible implemented (see sprs_implemented.txt).
 2) Some intructions are not implemented (see instructions.ods).
 3) To reduce memory footprint the exceptions are remodelled as:
    $X0000000 -> Magic number
    $X0000008 -> Instruction cache error
    $X0000010 -> Data cache error
    $X0000018 -> IRQ exception
    $X0000020 -> Invalid instruction exception
    $F0000028 -> System Call
    $X0000030 -> Reset vector
    Where: X = F by default for a BIOS and can be changed to 0 by invoking the
               asm volatile ("l.jumps") instruction in c
               that jumps to $0000030 and sets the exception area to $00000000.
 4) Added a NIOSII compatible custom instruction
 5) Due to the I$ implementation all jump/branch instructions have a penalty of 1
    extra NOP instruction (read to comply to the single delay slot of the OR1k
    one NOP is inserted; if wanted one could modify the compiler to take into
    account two delay slots, similar to the more modern MIPS processors, and the
    NOP insertion can be removed).
 6) The bus is a simple propriatary one.
 7) The overflow-bit is supressed
